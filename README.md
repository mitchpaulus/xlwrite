# `xlwrite`

`xlwrite` is a command line utility to take data from text files and put
them into Excel files.


## Notes

This project relies on EPPlus. If you are running the tool in a
non-Windows environment, you will need to install `libgdiplus`.

On Ubuntu or Debian based OS's this is:

```sh
sudo apt install libgdiplus
```
